<p>You are not a real engineer. You are a creature with a terrible countenance the stature of a man the head of an eagle with six wings about you and eyes uncountable, like burning torches the belt at your waist is a serpent with two heads and no tail your breath is the gathering of stormclouds your voice is the thundering of the wind the grass withers before your footsteps and your tongue is as black as shadow and brings apocalypse on everything it touches</p>
<p>Please be informed we will not be offering you the role at this time weâ€™re taking our chances with Bradwick</p>
