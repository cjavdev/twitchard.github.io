<p>You are not a real engineer. You are a creature with a terrible countenance the stature of a man and the head on an eagle with sixteen wings about you white as fresh snow hundreds of blinking eyes that burn like torches and point in all directions the belt at your waist is a serpent your breath is the gathering of stormclouds your voice is the thundering of the wind the grass withers before your footsteps and your writhing, ponderous tongue black as the abyss brings apocalypse upon everything it touches</p>
<p>We regret to inform you we will not be offering you the role at this time Weâ€™ll take our chances with Bradwick</p>
