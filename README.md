## About this documentation
This documentation aims to serve both as a general introduction 


# Getting Started 

## Building From Source
Building human organisms from source is not recommended, as it requires a [very specialized build environment](http://wwwmigrate.usccb.org/bible/genesis/2). It is well beyond the scope of this documentation.

## Acquiring a Prebuilt Package
Due to the practical and legal difficulties involved in the [distribution of pre-packaged human beings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mail#Real_occurrences), this method is also no longer recommended.

## Richard as a Service 
All the functionality of the Richard J Marmorstein system is available on demand through the Richard Marmorstein Foundation's centralized instance. Indeed, this is the recommended method of access.
