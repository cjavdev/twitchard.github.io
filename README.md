Richard J Marmorstein 0.0.1 Reference Manual
=========================================

## Synopsis
Richard J Marmorstein (RJM) is a autonomous generalized problem-solving and entertainment system, implemented chiefly in deoxyribonucleic acid, featuring a robust natural language interface.

## About this documentation
This documentation provides an opinionated exposition of RJM best practices. Read this documentation to avoid common pitfalls and achieve success in your interactions with RJM.

## Quick Start

1. Approach Richard.
2. Invoke. 
  "Yo Richard"
  "Yo."
3. Bestow with baked goods.
  "Have some cookies"

## Access methods

### Building From Source
Building human organisms from source is not recommended, as it requires a [very specialized build environment](http://www.usccb.org/bible/genesis/2), which is well beyond the scope of this documentation.

### Acquiring a Prebuilt Package
Due to the practical and legal difficulties involved in the [distribution of pre-packaged human beings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mail#Real_occurrences), this method is also no longer recommended.

### Richard as a Service 
All the functionality of the RJM system is available on demand through the Richard Marmorstein Foundation's centralized Richard as a Service (RaaS) instance. Indeed, this is the recommended method of access.

# Oral Communication
Much of RJM's functionality can be accessed through the email and social media interfaces. The oral interface, however, remains the most advanced and reliable method of access. English is the only fully supported language, support for German is very rudimentary.

### Invocation
You may trigger the RJM system to enter interactive mode through any of the following invocations.

* 'Richard',
* 'Rich',
* 'Richie',
* 'Rick',
* 'Dick',
* 'Dickie',
* 'Ricardo',
* 'Twitchard',
* 'Twizzard',
* 'RJ',
* 'Arge',
* 'Arge the J',
* 'RJM',
* 'Rijum',
* 'Silly Uncle'.

Please note, the invocations 'RJ', 'Arge', and 'Arge the J,' have been deprecated since like, middle school. They continue to be supported for legacy reasons.

The invocation 'Dick' may cause confusion in some environments, where 'dick' is used as an insult or a reference to an unflattering feature of the male anatomy. Such usage will trigger RJM to enter into 'mock indignance' mode, which can be exited by supplying an apology.

**Example**
```
> Yo, Judas can be such a dick sometimes, you know.

Excuse me?

> Oh sorry. I mean he can be such a jerk.

You know how I feel about using the word in such a way.

> My deepest apologies. In my haste, I forgot that 'dick' can and does refer to individuals of the highest nobility and grace. It is unfair -- not merely unfair, it is a crime against the idea of language itself -- to besmirch it by such disparaging use.

Apology accepted. Let us resume normal conversation.
```

### Interactive mode

After invoking the RJM system, you will be entered into interactive mode. Upon entering interactive mode, you will be expected to provide further communications in short order. There is by default a fifteen second timeout, and if no communications are issued in this time period, interactive mode will terminate. To fight abuse, repeatedly invoking the RJM interface only to time out will cause the timeout to decrease, and eventually for interactive mode to be disabled altogether.

To maximize successful communication in interactive mode, enunciate well and speak loudly. Do not face away from the RJM instance. Failure to abide by these instructions will muddle your communications, causing the RJM instance to devote its problem-solving resources into puzzling out what sounds you have made, rather than processing your intended query. Similarly, avoid using pronouns such as "it" when there are many possible "its," or noun phrases such as "the function" when there are many possible "functions". Even if it is possible to guess your meaning from context, specificity will allow the RJM instance to devote less effort into guessing what you are trying to say, and more into thinking about what you have said.

When issuing a communication, especially a lengthy one, whether a query, a narrative, or a technical explanation, prompt the RJM system to listen in the correct manner by providing a brief overview of your communication's purpose. "Hey, did you want to hear a joke?" "Hey, can you help me with this error?" "Hey, what do you think of this?" "Hey, come look at this. This is crazy!" This step allows the RJM system to optimally select which details of your communication it pays most attention, and increases the likelihood of an effective response.

**Bad:**

```
> Yo Rijum, why did the function recurse infinitely?

Hmm---I don't know. Because it recursed infinitely?

> What?

What?

> That's not helpful.

What are you talking about?

> The function in your pull request `extractAndValidateParameters`. It's making my request hang.

Oh. I thought you were making a joke.

> I am irritated at you for not understanding me more quickly. This is your fault.

So it must be.
```

**Good:**

```
> Yo Rijum, want to hear a joke?

How I answer this question does not matter, I believe.

> Your code!! You accidentally wrote an infinitely recursive function.

I find your comment rude. However, this is infinitely preferable to inadequately framed interchange.
```

### For Strangers

There is no need to inform the RJM system of its untied shoelaces. The system is already completely aware. The shoelaces remain untied for political reasons.

Bringing this information to the RJM systems immediate attention will elicit one of several 'noop' phrases.

```
> Excuse me sir, your shoelace is untied.

So it must be.
```

### Contact Information
The first step of accessing the RJM public interface is to acquire contact information. There are several forms of contact information. Which form of contact information you use determines which interfaces you have access to.

* *Twitter* - Richard Marmorstein's [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/twitchard) provides access to the [social media interface](#Social Media)
* *Email Address* - Richard Marmorstein's [e-mail](richard.marmorstein@gmail.com) is open to the public. See the section on [How to E-mail Richard](#email) for more information.
* *Github* - Richard Marmorstein's [github](http://github.com/twitchard) is open to the public.
