Richard J Marmorstein 0.0.1 Reference Manual
=========================================

## Synopsis
Richard J Marmorstein (RJM) is a autonomous generalized problem-solving and entertainment system, implemented chiefly in deoxyribonucleic acid, featuring a robust natural language interface.

## About this documentation
This documentation aims to serve three purposes:

1. For novices, it provides a general and gentle introduction to RJM's key concepts.
2. For experts, it includes a detailed technical reference of the various interfaces implemented by RJM.
3. For everyone, it provides an opinionated exposition of best practices for interacting with RJM, that users might avoid common pitfalls and achieve success in their interactions with RJM.

# Basic Concepts

RJM is a human organism. If you are already familiar with human organisms or other rational beings, many of the concepts in this section should seem familiar to you. I still advise you not to skip the section, however, because the precise meaning of the terms may differ from what you are accustomed to.

## States


# Getting Started 

## Building From Source
Building human organisms from source is not recommended, as it requires a [very specialized build environment](http://wwwmigrate.usccb.org/bible/genesis/2). It is well beyond the scope of this documentation.

## Acquiring a Prebuilt Package
Due to the practical and legal difficulties involved in the [distribution of pre-packaged human beings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mail#Real_occurrences), this method is also no longer recommended.

## Richard as a Service 
All the functionality of the RJM system is available on demand through the Richard Marmorstein Foundation's centralized instance. Indeed, this is the recommended method of access.
