This documentation is provided free of charge, as a stand-alone document. Possession of this documentation in no way grants the reader right of access to RJM, or the services described herein.

## Synopsis
Richard J Marmorstein (RJM) is a autonomous generalized problem-solving and entertainment system, implemented chiefly in deoxyribonucleic acid, featuring a robust natural language interface.

## About this documentation
This documentation provides an opinionated exposition of RJM best practices. Read this documentation to avoid common pitfalls and achieve success in your interactions with RJM.

## Quick Start

1. Approach the RJM system.
2. Invoke.

```
> Yo Richard

Yo
```

3. Bestow with baked goods.

```
> Have some cookies

Hey, thanks!
```

## Access methods

### Building From Source
Building human organisms from source is not recommended, as it requires a [very specialized build environment](http://www.usccb.org/bible/genesis/2), which is well beyond the scope of this documentation.

### Acquiring a Prebuilt Package
Due to the practical and legal difficulties involved in the [distribution of pre-packaged human beings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mail#Real_occurrences), this method is also no longer recommended.

### Richard as a Service 
All the functionality of the RJM system is available on demand through the Richard Marmorstein Foundation's centralized Richard as a Service (RaaS) instance. Indeed, this is the recommended method of access.

# Oral Communication
Much of RJM's functionality can be accessed through the email and social media interfaces. The oral interface, however, remains the most advanced and reliable method of access. English is the only fully supported language, support for German is very rudimentary.

### Invocation
You may trigger the RJM system to enter interactive mode through any of the following invocations.

* 'Richard',
* 'Rich',
* 'Richie',
* 'Rick',
* 'Dick',
* 'Dickie',
* 'Ricardo',
* 'Twitchard',
* 'Twizzard',
* 'RJ',
* 'Arge',
* 'Arge the J',
* 'RJM',
* 'Rijum',
* 'Silly Uncle'.

Please note, the invocations 'RJ', 'Arge', and 'Arge the J,' have been deprecated since like, middle school. They continue to be supported for legacy reasons.

The invocation 'Dick' may cause confusion in some environments, where 'dick' is used as an insult or a reference to an unflattering feature of the male anatomy. Such usage will trigger RJM to enter into 'mock indignance' mode, which can be exited by supplying an apology.

**Example**
```
> Yo, Judas can be such a dick sometimes, you know.

Excuse me?

> Oh sorry. I mean he can be such a jerk.

You know how I feel about using the word in such a way.

> My deepest apologies. In my haste, I forgot that 'dick' can and does refer to individuals of the highest nobility and grace. It is unfair -- not merely unfair, it is a crime against the idea of language itself -- to besmirch it by such disparaging use.

Apology accepted. Let us resume normal conversation.
```

### Interactive mode

After invoking the RJM system, you will be entered into interactive mode. Upon entering interactive mode, you will be expected to provide further communications in short order. There is by default a fifteen second timeout, and if no communications are issued in this time period, interactive mode will terminate. To fight abuse, repeatedly invoking the RJM interface only to time out will cause the timeout to decrease, and eventually for interactive mode to be disabled altogether.

To maximize successful communication in interactive mode, enunciate well and speak loudly. Do not face away from the RJM instance. Failure to abide by these instructions will muddle your communications, causing the RJM instance to devote its problem-solving resources into puzzling out what sounds you have made, rather than processing your intended query. Similarly, avoid using pronouns such as "it" when there are many possible "its," or noun phrases such as "the function" when there are many possible "functions". Even if it is possible to guess your meaning from context, specificity will allow the RJM instance to devote less effort into guessing what you are trying to say, and more into thinking about what you have said.

When issuing a communication, especially a lengthy one, whether a query, a narrative, or a technical explanation, prompt the RJM system to listen in the correct manner by providing a brief overview of your communication's purpose. "Hey, did you want to hear a joke?" "Hey, can you help me with this error?" "Hey, what do you think of this?" "Hey, come look at this. This is crazy!" This step allows the RJM system to optimally select which details of your communication it pays most attention, and increases the likelihood of an effective response.

**Bad:**

```
> Yo Rijum, why did the function recurse infinitely?

Hmm---I don't know. Because it recursed infinitely?

> What?

What?

> That's not helpful.

What are you talking about?

> The function in your pull request `extractAndValidateParameters`. It's making my request hang.

Oh. I thought you were making a joke.

> I am irritated at you for not understanding me more quickly. This is your fault.

So it is, and so it must be.
```

**Good:**

```
> Yo Rijum, want to hear a joke?

How I answer this question does not matter, I believe.

> Your code!! You accidentally wrote an infinitely recursive function.

I find your comment rude. However, this is infinitely preferable to inadequately framed interchange.
```

### For Strangers

#### Shoelaces
There is no need to inform the RJM system of its untied shoelaces. This is considered a valid state. The system is already completely aware. The shoelaces remain untied for political reasons.

Bringing this information to the RJM systems immediate attention will elicit one of several 'noop' phrases.

```
> Excuse me sir, your shoelace is untied.

So it is, and so it must be.
```

#### Backpack

On the other hand, if you observe RJM system walking around with an opened backpack, this is not intended. RJM has entered an invalid state. Filing a bug report will result in a sincere thank you and immediate action to correct it.

#### Directions

Asking the RJM system for directions is **not** recommended. The directions module is known to be wildly inaccurate. Nevertheless, if you are lost and ask for directions, RJM's pity engine will execute and trigger a misplaced desire to help, which will generate directions, such as they may be. Do not trust them. You are better off asking the next person.

### For Acquaintances

### For Colleagues

### For Family

### For Those Who Deem Themselves Friends

#### Gifts

The RJM system features the capacity to exhibit genuine enjoyment. One way to access this functionality is through the giving of gifts. However, this is not as straightforward as it may seem.

The most reliably successful method of gift-giving is via small, ad-hoc gifts such as baked goods. The RJM system suffers from no allergies. Such gifts are almost always accepted and appreciated.

Far riskier is the giving of significant gifts, or the giving of gifts upon special occasions such as a birthday or Christmas. Even if the gifted item is intrinsically something appreciated by the RJM system, when you give such a gift, you also give:
1. The gift of guilt, if the RJM system has not also given you a gift.
2. The gift of guilt, if the RJM system has given you a gift but yours is perceived to be more valuable.
3. The gift of the obligation to display gratitude.

Often, these secondary gifts countervene any tendency of your gift to elicit genuine enjoyment from the RJM system. The recommended practice, therefore, is not to give such gifts at all. Stick with baked goods.

#### Sacrifices

Offering sacrifices to the RJM system will instill immense spiritual disquiet. It is not recommended.

#### Favors

When you are able to help the RJM system with a problem it has described to you, you may offer to perform a favor. The best practice is to offer the favor first, and ask about relevant details second.

***Not recommended***
```
> You want a cookie?
I can't, I'm about to go to a dentist appointment.

> What is the address of your dentist?
Uhh... why?

> I can drive you there. I'm headed into town anyway.
No thanks, I'm good.

> Why not?
This conversation is highly uncomfortable.
```

***Recommended***
```
> You want a cookie?
I can't, I'm about to go to a dentist appointment.

> Hey, you want me to drive you? I'm headed into town anyway.
That's nice of you to offer, but no thanks, I think I'm good.
```
