Richard J Marmorstein 0.0.1 Reference Manual
=========================================

## Synopsis
Richard J Marmorstein (RJM) is a autonomous generalized problem-solving and entertainment system, implemented chiefly in deoxyribonucleic acid, featuring a robust natural language interface.

## About this documentation
This documentation aims to serve three purposes:

1. For novices, it provides a general and gentle introduction to RJM's key concepts.
2. For experts, it includes a detailed technical reference of the various interfaces implemented by RJM.
3. For everyone, it provides an opinionated exposition of best practices for interacting with RJM, that users might avoid common pitfalls and achieve success in their interactions with RJM.

# Getting Started 

## Building From Source
Building human organisms from source is not recommended, as it requires a [very specialized build environment](http://wwwmigrate.usccb.org/bible/genesis/2), which is well beyond the scope of this documentation.

## Acquiring a Prebuilt Package
Due to the practical and legal difficulties involved in the [distribution of pre-packaged human beings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mail#Real_occurrences), this method is also no longer recommended.

## Richard as a Service 
All the functionality of the RJM system is available on demand through the Richard Marmorstein Foundation's centralized instance. Indeed, this is the recommended method of access.

### Accessing The RJM Public Interface
#### Invocation
You may trigger the RJM system to enter interactive mode through the invocations.
'Richard',
'Rich',
'Richie',
'Rick',
'Dick',
'Dickie',
'Ricardo',
'Twitchard',
'RJ',
'Arge',
'Arge the J',
'RJM',
'Rijum',
or 'Silly Uncle'.

Please note, the invocations 'RJ', 'Arge', and 'Arge the J,' have been deprecated since like, middle school.

The invocation 'Dick' may cause confusion in some environments, where 'dick' is used as an insult or a reference to an unflattering feature of the male anatomy. Such usage will trigger RJM to enter into 'mock indignance' mode, which can be exited by supplying an apology.

*Examples:*

```
Excuse me,
```

#### Contact Information
The first step of accessing the RJM public interface is to acquire contact information. There are several forms of contact information. Which form of contact information you use determines which interfaces you have access to.
