Richard J Marmorstein 0.0.1 Reference Manual
=========================================

## Synopsis
Richard J Marmorstein (RJM) is a autonomous generalized problem-solving and entertainment system, implemented chiefly in deoxyribonucleic acid, featuring a robust natural language interface.

## About this documentation
This documentation provides an opinionated exposition of RJM best practices. Read this documentation to avoid common pitfalls and achieve success in your interactions with RJM.

## Quick Start

1. Approach Richard.
2. Invoke. 
  "Yo Richard"
  "Yo."
3. Bestow with baked goods.
  "Have some cookies"

## Access methods

### Building From Source
Building human organisms from source is not recommended, as it requires a [very specialized build environment](http://www.usccb.org/bible/genesis/2), which is well beyond the scope of this documentation.

### Acquiring a Prebuilt Package
Due to the practical and legal difficulties involved in the [distribution of pre-packaged human beings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mail#Real_occurrences), this method is also no longer recommended.

### Richard as a Service 
All the functionality of the RJM system is available on demand through the Richard Marmorstein Foundation's centralized Richard as a Service (RaaS) instance. Indeed, this is the recommended method of access.

# Oral Communication
Much of RJM's functionality can be accessed through the email and social media interfaces. The oral interface, however, remains the most advanced and reliable method of access. English is the only fully supported language, support for German is very rudimentary.

### Invocation
You may trigger the RJM system to enter interactive mode through any of the following invocations.

* 'Richard',
* 'Rich',
* 'Richie',
* 'Rick',
* 'Dick', 'Dickie',
* 'Ricardo',
* 'Twitchard',
* 'Twizzard',
* 'RJ',
* 'Arge',
* 'Arge the J',
* 'RJM',
* 'Rijum',
* 'Silly Uncle'.

Please note, the invocations 'RJ', 'Arge', and 'Arge the J,' have been deprecated since like, middle school. They continue to be supported for legacy reasons.

The invocation 'Dick' may cause confusion in some environments, where 'dick' is used as an insult or a reference to an unflattering feature of the male anatomy. Such usage will trigger RJM to enter into 'mock indignance' mode, which can be exited by supplying an apology.

**Example Apology 1**

> My sincerest apoligies, I should not have described Judas Iscariot as a 'dick'. In my haste I forgot that 'dick' can and does refer to individuals of the highest nobility and grace, and it is not fair to compare such dignified creatures to the likes of Judas Iscariot.

**Example Apology 2**

> I am very sorry to have offended you. I, of course, fully realize that 'dick' refers to a magnificent creature with a variety of anatomical features, and there is no excuse for reducing that proud name to a single, unflattering one. I resolve to be less vulgar in the future.

### Interactive mode

After invoking the RJM system, you will be entered into interactive mode. Upon entering interactive mode, you will be expected to provide further communications in short order. There is by default a fifteen second timeout, and if no communications are issued in this time period, interactive mode will terminate. To fight abuse, repeatedly invoking the RJM interface only to time out will cause the timeout to decrease, and eventually for interactive mode to be disabled altogether.

To maximize successful communication in interactive mode, enunciate well and speak loudly. Do not face away from the RJM instance. Failure to abide by these instructions will muddle your communications, causing the RJM instance to devote its problem-solving resources into puzzling out what sounds you have made, rather than processing your intended query. Similarly, avoid using pronouns such as "it" when there are many possible "its," or noun phrases such as "the function" when there are many possible "functions". Even if it is possible to guess your meaning from context, specificity will allow the RJM instance to devote less effort into guessing what you are trying to say, and more into thinking about what you have said.

When issuing a lengthy communication, whether a narrative or technical explanation, prompt the RJM system to listen in the correct manner by providing a brief overview of your communication's purpose. "Hey, do you have any idea why I am getting this error?" "Hey, what do you think of the way I refactored this code?" "Hey, isn't this block of legacy code crazy?" This step allows the RJM system to optimally select which details of your communication it pays most attention, and increases the likelihood of an effective response.
