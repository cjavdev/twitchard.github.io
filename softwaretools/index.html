## Why not just use Facebook live?

- Many organizations have custom requirements.
- **Example:** What if you only have the rights to broadcast in certain geographical areas?

## What do I do at Livestream?
- "Platform Engineering Team"
- I'll give you an example

## What am I going to talk about

- Tool we use called "Tracker" for Agile task management.
- Tool we use called "Concourse" for Continuous Integration.
- Questions at the end
  - Happy to talk about NYC tech scene.
  - Happy to talk about javascript
  - Happy to talk about any of the software tools I use.
  - Happy to talk about Arraylists.

## Sneak Peek at Concourse

[Concourse](https://concourse.gce.livestream.com)

## Pivotal Tracker
**Background:**
- Made by 'Pivotal labs'
- Describe it as 25% Scrum, 75% Kanban.

## Tracker
**Background:**
- Made by 'Pivotal labs'
- Describe it as 25% Scrum, 75% Kanban.

**Agile according to Richard**

- "Higher-order engineering."
- You engineer your product.
- You engineer the process by which you engineer your product.
- How to measure effectiveness of your process?
- Tracker helps you.

---
## Tracker

- Every unit of work is called a **Story**

---
## Tracker

- Every unit of work is called a **Story**

- Every story is assigned 0, 1, 2, 4, or 8 **Points**

## Tracker

- Every unit of work is called a **Story**

- Every story is assigned 0, 1, 2, 4, or 8 **Points**

- How many **points** you deliver each week determines your **velocity**

- Every story is assigned 0, 1, 2, 4, or 8 **Points**

- How many **points** you deliver each week determines your **velocity**

- A point is a guess at how much **work** a story is, *not* how much time you think it will take.

- How many **points** you deliver each week determines your **velocity**

- A point is a guess at how much **work** a story is, *not* how much time you think it will take.

- (If your process improves, your point estimates shouldn't go down -- your velocity should go up)

---

## Kinds of stories

---

## Kinds of stories

**Bugs** - Always get 0 points.

## Kinds of stories

**Bugs** - Always get 0 points.

Otherwise, you would get fewer points for fixing the bug before delivering the story.

.

**Chores** - Also get 0 points.

Chores should increase *tomorrow's* velocity, not today's

**Features** - Actually do get points.

Reflects immediate value added to the product.

## How is a feature story born?

1. Product Handoff
  - We get a mock-up
  - Also a google doc with English descriptions of the desired experience.

2. Inception Meeting
  - We make a plan how to build it. (whiteboard)

## Let me show you tracker!

---

## Tracker

- Tracker helps to estimate release dates.
- Tracker helps you test changes to your process.

### Agile "Toolbox"

- Daily standups
- Fire chief / Build Cop
- Pair programming
- "Tracks" vs. "Pick the top story"
- Assigning whole team to a single track?
- "Two thumbs" rule.
- Using a new tool, like Concourse, or a linter.
- RFCs

Some things work, some don't. Try it out. Pivotal will let you see how this affects velocity. Keep what works!

## Ok, now onto concourse!

Let's see what happened.
