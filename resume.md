**I am** a versatile, pragmatic developer with 3 years of professional experience.

**I am looking for** the opportunity to solve challenging problems with a colorful set of teammates, to build a product I can take pride in.

**I value** imagination, thorough testing of code and ideas, and clear communication.


## Professional Experience {#experience}

### Platform Backend Engineer - Livestream (Feb 2015 - Present)

**Application Development** -
With a team of 5 other developers, I maintained and developed Livestream's internal REST API, which powers the SaaS live video platform. Some projects I was heavily involved in:

- Rearchitecting Livestream's authentication service to withstand more load and be more secure.
- Contributing to both the frontend (Angular.js) and backend of [Livestream's "Simulcast" feature](https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/livestream-simulcast/).
- Developing "Dragonscaler", a custom autoscaler for GCS vms that met our video infrastructure's unique requirements.
- Migrating our applications to the cloud.

**DevOps** -
I also took an active role in the operations of the application. For example, I provisioned servers, load tested new services, set up monitoring and instrumentation, and I configured load balancers, databases, and HTTP caches.

**Agile Project Management** -
In July of 2017, I adopted project management responsibilities for the team: prioritizing, speccing, and scheduling the team's work, conducting the weekly planning meeting and bi-weekly retrospective meetings, and coordinating with outside stakeholders. 

**Blog** - I contributed several technical blog posts to the [Livestream engineering blog](https://medium.com/engineering-livestream).

**Technologies -** Node.js, Go, Redis, MySQL, Varnish, GCS, Docker, Kubernetes, Angular.js, Puppet
