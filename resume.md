## Professional Experience {#experience}

### Platform Backend Engineer - Livestream/Vimeo (Feb 2015 - Present)

*Livestream was acquired by Vimeo in September 2017*

**Application Development** -
With a team of 5 other developers, I maintained and developed Livestream's internal REST API, which powers the SaaS live video platform. Some projects I was heavily involved in:

- Scaling Livestream's authentication service
- Contributing to both the frontend and backend of [Livestream's "Simulcast" feature](https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/livestream-simulcast/).
- Developing "Dragonscaler", a custom autoscaler that met our video infrastructure's unique requirements.

**DevOps** -
I also took an active role in the operations of the application. For example, I provisioned servers, load tested new services, set up monitoring and instrumentation, and I configured load balancers, databases, and HTTP caches.

**Agile Project Management** -
In July of 2017, I adopted project management responsibilities for the team: prioritizing, speccing, and scheduling the team's work, conducting the weekly planning meeting and bi-weekly retrospective meetings, and coordinating with outside stakeholders. 

**Blog** - I contributed several technical blog posts to the [Livestream engineering blog](https://medium.com/engineering-livestream).

**Technologies ** - Node.js, Go, Redis, MySQL, Varnish, GCS, Docker, Kubernetes, Scala, Angular.js, Puppet
